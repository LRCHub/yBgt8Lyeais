Here I stand I'm all alone
I can't help to feel regret
About the way I made
You leave last night

Embrace the glance
Of satisfaction
I don't know what you mean
But it was one thing
That I knew before
We had converged
My life filled with solitude
Now turn to pure paradise

Night call girl
Can't afford you but
You're my world
And I know that you will
Let me up inside
When I'm feeling down
And need some love you're my
Night call girl
You must remember that
You're my world
And you know I you don't
Let me up inside my feelings
Fly away so far away
I won't call you anymore
